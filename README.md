## Problem Statement
Version control and source code management are some of the most striking features of GitHub. Programmers use this site to network and exchange ideas. Employers and recruiters use it to evaluate software developers. In addition to gaining valuable insights into user behavior, the repositories on GitHub can also provide us with useful information on the current technologies that developers are using today and the technologies that make a repository popular.<br>

## Dataset Description
It is derived from scraping top-starred GitHub repositories covering a wide range of topics. A Python library called BeautifulSoup was used to scrape the data. Its primary purpose is to analyze the most popular repositories on GitHub. Data-Science, Machine-Learning, Computer-Vision, etc, are among the topics covered in the dataset, along with repository commits, issues, forks, etc.
